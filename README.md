## Hi there 👋

<!--
**JesusLoveRN/JesusLoveRN** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working as an RN and I'm currently working on 2 Vibecode Apps; NurseRx-Pro, and VibeCode: Care Plan. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to vibecode and completely develop an app, as well as how to use GitHub.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, just learning. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with App Development and integrations and how to use GitHub. 
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to Nursing!
- 📫 How to reach me: AScottRN@icloud.com or I'm sure there's a way on here
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've so far Vibecoded 2 apps without any coding/programming knowledge whatsoever!
